# El tiempo Cataluña

Project to display the weather forecast for the next 3 days in any town in Cataluña, Spain. I did this project to practice the usage of an external API. Key project functionalities:

  - Search functionality to search your desired town in Cataluña.
  - After you search for a town, a table will be populated with the corresponding data. The current hour is highlighted.
  - Different icons will be loaded for the different sky conditions + if it is day or night time.
  - Your last search will be stored in "Local Storage" so when you revisit the website, your last search will be displayed automatically.

## Tech used

HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
